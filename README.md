# socnetProject

Proposition:

Use Gowalla data and find all communties using networkx code

Select the tightest knit communiteis (most dense? shortest paths?)

Display the general (avg?) location of the communites to a US map in an HTML doc

Overlay an existing map of the areas where the population is of low socio-econimc status

Include a breif description of our hypothesis & an analysis of how our results came out


  issue 1 - how to display the networkx graph
  
  issue 2 - how do we overlay a graph onto the networkx graph
  
  issue 3 - how will we determine what constitutes a tightly knit community
