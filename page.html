	<h1>Final Project for Socail Networking & Informatics</h2>
	<p>For Our project we used the data set from Gowalla to analyze if people of lower economic status tend to have strong ties and exist in smaller tighter knit communities. We intend to extract the communities from the Gowalla dataset and analyze the network by applying an economic map over a map of the communities found in our search. By scaling the data down to only US locations, we were better able to determine the communities that exist within the network. We intended to determine the communities by finding strong ties and determining the bridges that exist in the system, then removing them using the gervin newman algorithm. In order to find these communities, we are assuming that people in poverty tend to have stronger ties within their communities and this will help us produce the data we need to analyze the networks of people in poverty to compare agianst the map of economic status within the US.</p>
	<p>Our assumption is that people in poverty tend to depend highly on their strong ties rather than weak ties. So, we wanted to analyze the impact that this may have on the size of their social networks and their access to social networks.</p>
